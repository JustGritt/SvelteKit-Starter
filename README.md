# SvelteKit-Starter

> This is a starter template for [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), a framework for building web applications of all sizes, with a lot of the hassle taken out. The temaplate contains a basic setup for a SvelteKit project with [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/install) support, and a basic layout with a header and footer.

## Run the project

You will have to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) first then run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

To start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and the page should reload with your changes.

## Build the project

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized version of your app in the `build` directory. You can also preview the built app with `npm run preview`. Learn more about SvelteKit's [build process](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#ssr-and-javascript-prerender).

## Learn more

To learn more about SvelteKit, check out the [documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs). You can also find the [SvelteKit Discord](https://discord.gg/svelte) and [SvelteKit subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sveltekit/) helpful. If you have a question, you can ask it on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sveltekit) with the `svelte` or `sveltekit` tag.

## Deploy

To deploy your app, follow the [instructions](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#ssr-and-javascript-prerender) in the SvelteKit documentation. You can also use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy your app.
